Credit card FDS using Hidden Markov Model
Credit card use has grown significantly as a result of the rapid evolution of e- commerce technology. Credit card fraud is on the rise as it replaces cash as the preferred method of payment for both offline and online purchases. In order to prevent customers from being charged for products they did not buy, credit card firms must be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. In this study, we employ a Hidden Markov Model to model the steps involved in processing credit card transactions and demonstrate how it can be applied to the detection of fraud. A Hidden Markov Model is initially trained using a cardholder's typical behavior. An incoming credit card transaction is deemed fraudulent if the trained Model does not accept it with a high enough probability. At the same time, we work to prevent the rejection of actual transactions. To demonstrate the success of our strategy and compare it to other methods described in the literature, we give comprehensive experimental results.
